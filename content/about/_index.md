Hi, I'm Annie. I'm from the cold fjords of the north, but I like to think I have a warm heart. I'm a lifelong student, and an artist and designer. I make worlds in my freetime, and stories to go in them. Right now, I'm telling the story of an alternate version of our solar system; the science fantasy world of Solaris. I also write the Morning Realm, a classical fantasy world that marries the nostalgic escapism of youth with the sensitivity of the present.

> Nnie is a joy to work with and commission from. She has this way of cutting through to the emotions of a scene, and they shine though the finished piece in all sorts of little details. I will absolutely be commissioning more Paint sketches from her in the future, especially as I work through clothing design and character relationships.

> Annie made three illustrations for me, and every time working with her was a pleasure. From the start, I love her art style, but I never had art commissioned before, and I had doubts about whether I would really get something fitting what I had in mind, especially as I have troubles visualising anything. Annie was really supportive with all phases of the projects. She made great suggestions and helped me clarify and refine my concepts in ways that were useful for the whole project beyond the illustrations themselves. While working on the illustrations, we kept discussing the different elements, whether I was satisfied with the current drafts, and how we could proceed with the next steps. I loved both working with Annie and the art pieces she made for me. Now I look forward to having another piece to ask her to draw for me.
