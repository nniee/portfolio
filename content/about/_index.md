Hi, I'm Annie. I'm from the cold fjords of the north, but I like to think I have a warm heart. I'm a lifelong student, and an artist and designer. I make worlds in my freetime, and stories to go in them. Right now, I'm telling the story of an alternate version of our solar system; the science fantasy world of Solaris. I also write the Morning Realm, a classical fantasy world that marries the nostalgic escapism of youth with the sensitivity of the present.

> Nnie is a joy to work with and commission from. She has this way of cutting through to the emotions of a scene, and they shine though the finished piece in all sorts of little details. I will absolutely be commissioning more Paint sketches from her in the future, especially as I work through clothing design and character relationships.
