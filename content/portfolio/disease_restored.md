Disease Restored was an extensive mod project I worked on with Peter Han and Skye Im. I was the artist for the project, making several graphics and even a new animated asset.

**Tools of the trade**: Photoshop

Peter Han and Skye Im were established mod creators for Oxygen Not Included. I had worked on a series of thumbnails for Skye's mods and was asked to make art for a mod idea they had. My contributions included drawing and animating an UV cleaner, and a series of graphics to explain what the mod changed and how it worked.

Peter Han and Skye Im hoped to make many more mods in the same series, revamping basic features of the game. I developed a consistent branding for the mod series to make it immediately recognizable to the community.
