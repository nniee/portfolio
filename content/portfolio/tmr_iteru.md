 Creating the Iteru article was a labour of love. Inspired by the illustrated history books I adored as a kid, I wanted to draw the river running through the article.

 I started by deciding how many sections, and approximately how much text I wanted in each. Once I had a rough estimation, I threw some placeholder text into my article to see how long the river would need to be to fit all my desired text. 

 The illustration was ten times as large as the article, to give myself plenty space to work with. I had a map which gave me a rough outline of how the river should go. I put up guide marks, and started to draw the outline of the river. 

 The next task was to export it and place the text. This would give me an idea of where I could do more illustration, and where it would be too dense to add anything. I would alternate between writing, moving the text around, researching plants that fit the biome, and drawing. 

 Slowly but surely, each section was filled in. I would show this in a gif form here, but that would absolutely destroy your bandwidth. You can [see the finished result here.](https://www.worldanvil.com/w/the-morning-realm-nnie/a/iteru-location)
