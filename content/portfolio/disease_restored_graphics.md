Concisely summarized the altered features of Disease Restored in a series of graphics. I wanted a style that matched the Oxygen Not Included Branding, but with our own spin on it.

**Tools of the Trade**: Photoshop

I was added to Reimagination Inc, the mod team, early on, since I would be creating an asset for them. I was working on refining the art and animating the UV Cleaner while they coded the rest of the mod. As I watched them discuss features and playtest, I made notes of what we were changing.

- Slide 1: diseases and symptoms overview
- Slide 2: frostbite and scalding
- Slide 3: germ transfer changes (sink, shower, irrigation)
- Slide 4: UV cleaner
- Slide 5: updates to cures

I put forward a suggestion of five slides, graphic images that would showcase various aspects of the mod. I wanted them to be funny and informative. I found a font that looked similar to the custom Oxygen Not Included font, and stuck closely to the offical branding of ONI. Skye Im helped take most of the screenshots, which I then edited in Photoshop.

 When making this final overview, we had a discussion about whether to write that the food poisoning medication had a 80% shorter duration, or healed 500% faster.

**Co-Creator**: 
> 80% duration feels easier to understand than healing 500% faster

**Me**: 
> I disagree.

**Co-Creator**:
> I can be convinced, try me

**Me**:
> It's far easier to misinterpret -80% 
>
> -80% works for people who are good at mental math, but takes more steps to understand since it's a negative, and a percentage of something. 500% you look at and immediately understand is bigger than 100%
