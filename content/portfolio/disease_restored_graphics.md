Concisely summarized the altered features of Disease Restored in a series of graphics. I wanted a style that matched the Oxygen Not Included Branding, but with our own spin on it.

**Tools of the Trade**: Photoshop

 When making this final overview, we had a discussion about whether to write that the food poisoning medication had a 80% shorter duration, or healed 500% faster.

Co-Creator: 
> 80% duration feels easier to understand than healing 500% faster

Me: 
> I disagree.

Co-Creator:
> I can be convinced, try me

Me:
> It's far easier to misinterpret -80% 
>
> 80% works for people who are good at mental math, but takes more steps to understand since it's a negative, and a percentage of something. 500% you look at and immediately understand is bigger than 100%
