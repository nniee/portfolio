A retooling of the World Anvil UI on Mobile to improve legibility, give access to more tools, and prevent the user triggering tools while reading.

**Tools of the Trade**: CSS, World Anvil

World Anvil has some excellent navigational tools by default. Among these is a table of contents for the entire world, as well as a button that takes you up to the top of an article. By default these elements float on either side of the screen, approximately in the middle.

On mobile I've found that makes it really easy to accidentally click them as I read. I decided to take a leaf out of the other mobile UIs I've seen and create a navigational hub at the bottom of the users screen. I migrated the table of content, the search bar and the back-to-top button down there. 

## Adapting New Elements ##

I also make sure that any new elements I create for World Anvil also adapt nicely to mobile. For example, in the article shown above I made a horizontal timeline for the full view of this article. The horizontal format makes great use of the landscape-style screen real estate on personal computers and laptops.

Since mobile is in portrait mode, it of course needed to be readapted to suit the vertical nature of phones. I collapsed and reordered the elements.
