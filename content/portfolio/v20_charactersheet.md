An easy-to-use Google Doc based character sheet for v20 Vampire the Masquerade. Made for an online game that I was one of the storytellers for.

  Above you can see my sheet compared with MrGone's Character Sheets, which are some of the most commonly used sheets for v20 players. The general structure is the same as default sheets, but the temporary stats are migrated into it's own page. 

  We wanted a sheet that was better adapted for online play and didn't require players or storytellers to use pdf editors. Google Documents became a good solution.

  ## Creation ##

  The V20 sheet was constructed using tables. This helped keep everything aligned, and made it easier to update for players without much knowledge on how to edit documents. 

  The first version of this sheet served more as a proof of concept. It was not particlularly good looking, but it functioned well.
