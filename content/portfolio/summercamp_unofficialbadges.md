I made some unofficial MS Paint badges for various purposes. The above was made during Summercamp 2021 for the World Anvil community to cheer people on for putting their health first. A crab variant also exists.

**Tools of the Trade**: Ms Paint

For fun, I also did the "ms paint" variants of the actual 2021 summercamp badges. The MS paint style is all about embracing mistakes. I find it to be a very approachable art style, that communicates the joy of art and encourages others to draw too.

Someone in the community asked, what if I don't complete enough for Copper?
