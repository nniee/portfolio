HistoricalSimmer, a youtuber who plays Sims 2 set in the Victorian Era made two  custom careers to suit her gameplay. Costermonger, and pottery. I made two icons for these careers to match the in game Sims 2 career icons.

**Tools of the Trade**: Photoshop

 My custom career icons alongside Sims 2 default icons. It was important that they fit in well with the default icons. Thankfully the default icons gave me a lot of room to play with. I liked how some of them use whitespace for details, and carried that forward in my own icons.


It started with some sketches to work out the concept and try out different ideas. I wanted something with a strong silhouette, as career icons are only 36x36px in game. They need to be readable.

> Oooh I love this! I really like the basket for costermonger. The kiln is so fun and I love how the basket and kiln share a distinctive drawing.
> I'll get to work writing chance cards for the careers so we can actually release these. I'm so excited!

The next step was to refine them into real icons, as seen below, and export them into the right size and format. Photoshop definitely was not the ideal program. While it has rudimentary vector tools, it doesn't handle merging and combining shapes anywhere near as well as Illustrator. This process would definitely have been faster with the proper tools.
