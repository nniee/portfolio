The UV Cleaner (shown above) was Peter Han's concept. He showed a pencil sketch of what he wanted, which I refined into the image above. I then segmented the art, and loaded it into spriter to animate it and the required states. 

**Tools of the Trade**: Spriter & Photoshop

> **Required States**
> - Off
> - Working (Animated)
> - Turning On (Animated, fills up with water)
> - Turning Off (Animated, empties out water)
> - Broken (sad :C)

Learning to mimic the art style and animation of Klei was a fun challenge. It's delightfully cartoony game, with so much room to get silly.
